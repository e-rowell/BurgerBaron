Simulates how a burger is made based on input from customer. The customer has a limited selection of ingredients, but can add and remove ingredients from the burger as they so desire. There are two styles in which a burger can be interpreted:
"'Patty Count' 'Patty Type' Baron Burger with no 'omissions' but 'exceptions'" or
"'Patty Count' 'Patty Type' Burger with 'additions' but no 'exceptions'".
The 'omissions' and 'additions' may include ingredients or categories of ingredients:
Categories ‐ Cheese, Sauce, Veggies 
Ingredients ‐ Cheddar, Mozzarella, Pepperjack, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, Pickle, Mushrooms, Ketchup, Mustard, Mayonnaise, and Baron

The program can take text orders in the format described and construct a custom burger with all ingredients in the list.
