The baron burger recipe is as follows (top to bottom): Pickle ‐ Skewered to the burger with the Baron’s Blade. ● Top Bun ● Mayonnaise ● Baron Sauce ● Lettuce ● Tomato ● Onions ● Pepperjack ● Mozzarella ● Cheddar ● Patty ‐ If there is more than one patty then the cheese goes on the bottom patty. ● Mushrooms ● Mustard ● Ketchup ● Bottom BuThe customer has a limited selection of ingredients, but can add and remove ingredients from the burger as they so desire. There are two styles in which a burger can be interpreted:
"'Patty Count' 'Patty Type' Baron Burger with no 'omissions' but 'exceptions'" or
"'Patty Count' 'Patty Type' Burger with 'additions' but no 'exceptions'".
The 'omissions' and 'additions' may include ingredients or categories of ingredients:
Categories ‐ Cheese, Sauce, Veggies; 
Ingredients ‐ Cheddar, Mozzarella, Pepperjack, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, Pickle, Mushrooms, Ketchup, Mustard, Mayonnaise, and Baron.
The 'exceptions' are always ingredients only and are exceptions to the categories listed in the 'omissions' or 'addition'.
